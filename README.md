# symlink-checker
A retool of the symlinks app for modern OS X support as well as the ability to output structured data.

This started from the "[symlinks](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/symlinks-1.4.tar.gz)" tool v1.4 by Mark Lord. As I am unable to easily judge his intent over the licensing of this source code I have marked it for now as GNU GPL v2, this is with the knowledge that he was active on the Linux project at one point and affords him the greater level of protection while I contact him to verify his intent.
