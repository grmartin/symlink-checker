# symlink-checker
A retool of the symlinks app for modern OS X support as well as the ability to output structured data.

This started from the "[symlinks](http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/symlinks-1.4.tar.gz)" tool v1.4 by Mark Lord. 

After contacting the author and coming to an agreement to simply use "As permissive a license as possible, please!", I would like to move this to Public domain, that is to say, if you feel like crediting us, we'd very much appreciate it, but it certainly is not required!

## The Public Domain

In the words of one of my favorite projects:
	
	// The author disclaims copyright to this source code.  In place of
	// a legal notice, here is a blessing:
	//
	//    May you do good and not evil.
	//    May you find forgiveness for yourself and forgive others.
	//    May you share freely, never taking more than you give.
